**Advanced Security & Monitoring Infrastructure**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of this task is to enhance the security posture of the Ubuntu Server by implementing advanced security controls and introducing monitoring capabilities. Building on the foundational security implemented in Week 4, this phase focused on access control enforcement, automated security maintenance, intrusion detection, and verification through scripting and remote monitoring.

By the end we want to see that the server had transitioned from a securely configured system to a self-maintaining platform. Advanced security controls were implemented, validated, and documented, meeting all Phase 5 requirements and establishing a strong foundation for future performance analysis and optimization.
