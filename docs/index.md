## Respository's
This repository documents a seven-week practical project focused on Linux server administration using a dual-system architecture.  
The project emphasises **command-line proficiency**, **security hardening**, **performance testing**, and **system analysis** rather than cloud or enterprise infrastructure design.

### System Architecture
- **Server:** Ubuntu Server (headless, administered via SSH)
- **Workstation:** Ubuntu Desktop / Host OS (remote administration & monitoring)
- **Virtualisation:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **Access Method:** Secure Shell (SSH)
